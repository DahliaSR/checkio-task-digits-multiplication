    <div class="answer">
        You will need to separate digits from the number.
        You can easily do this by converting the number into a string and work with it as with a sequence.
<pre class="brush: python">
str(20123) == "20123"
s = str(102)
s[0] == "1"
s[2] == "2"
for x in str(number):
    something
    </pre>

    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You can convert each string digit in a number with "int(s)"
<pre class="brush: python">
for s in str(number):
    n = int(s)
    </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
        Multiply digits and accumulate the result
<pre class="brush: python">
result = 1
for s in str(number):
    n = int(s)
    ...
    result *= n # result = result * n
    </pre>

    <div class="answer">
        In the last hint I "forgot" about zeroes. Of course you should skip them.
<pre class="brush: python">
if not n:  # if n == 0:
    continue
    </pre>
